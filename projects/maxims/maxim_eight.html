    The Black Crusaders are a secret group of powerful Black Americans. Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey are the chief majors, but Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell and Gordon from Sesame Street, they're members too, and they meet four times a year in the skull of the Statue of Liberty. You can read about that on the Interweb.
